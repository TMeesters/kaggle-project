The objective is to predict the revenue of shops, using a machine learning model. Each row of our data contains the following information:

## Dataset
* shop_ID : Shop's unique identifier.

* day_of_the_week : Encoded from 0 to 6.

* date : day, month and year of the data point.

* number of customers : Quantity of customers that showed up that day.

* open : Binary variable equal to 0 if shop closed that day and 1 if shop open.

* promotion : Binary variable equal to 0 if shop had no promotions that day and 1 if it did.

* state_holiday : Encoded 0, a, b, c indicating if there was a state holiday at all (0 if not), and otherwise, the number indicates which state holiday it was.

* school_holiday : Binary variable equal to 0 if there was a school holiday that day and 1 if not.

## Process
For this first:
* Load our data
* EDA and Data cleaning
* Splitting the data into test and train
* Review different models and its R2 (Linear regression, Decision Tree, Bagging regression, random forest and Adaboost regressor)
